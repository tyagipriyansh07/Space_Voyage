git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/cosmic-dashboard.git
cd cosmic-dashboard

#### 2. Backend Setup
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create a .env file in the backend directory
touch .env

# Add your NASA API key to the .env file
echo "NASA_API_KEY=YOUR_NASA_API_KEY_HERE" >> .env
echo "PORT=5000" >> .env

#### 3. Frontend Setup
# Navigate to the frontend directory from the root
cd ../frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the frontend development server
npm start

#### 4. Run the Application
Open two terminal windows:
In one, run the backend (cd backend && npm start).
In the other, run the frontend (cd frontend && npm start).
Access the app at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
If you encounter errors, check the terminal for messages and ensure the NASA API key is valid.
